## Quick presentation

Hey there ! I am HashBadG, a french cybersecurity engineer. I am currently searching for a job as I finished my academic studies. 

## Hobbies

Computers aren't my only passion, and I enjoy good music, minimalist art, hiking, and exploring new cultures through travel. I find inspiration in the vibrant colors of foreign markets, the rhythmic beats of traditional music, and the intricate designs of indigenous crafts. Immersing myself in different environments fuels my creativity and broadens my perspective, shaping the way I approach both technology and the world around me.

## CTF

I do some competitions with my CTF team, the [Phreaks2600](https://ctftime.org/team/200877/). I particularly enjoy challenges involving networking, DFIR and hardware.
